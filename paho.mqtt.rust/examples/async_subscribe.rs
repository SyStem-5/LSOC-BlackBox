// paho-mqtt/examples/async_subscribe.rs
// This is a Paho MQTT Rust client, sample application.
//
//! This application is an MQTT subscriber using the asynchronous client
//! interface of the Paho Rust client library, employing callbacks to
//! receive messages and status updates. It also monitors for disconnects
//! and performs manual re-connections.
//!
//! The sample demonstrates:
//!   - Connecting to an MQTT server/broker.
//!   - Subscribing to a topic
//!   - Receiving messages through the callback API
//!   - Receiving network disconnect updates and attempting manual reconnects.
//!   - Using a "clean session" and manually re-subscribing to topics on
//!     reconnect.
//!   - Last will and testament
//!
